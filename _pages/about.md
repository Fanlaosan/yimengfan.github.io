I am a first-year master's student from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn). I completed my bachelor's degree from [Hebei University of Technology](https://www.hebut.edu.cn), and my undergraduate GPA was 3.93/4.0. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and other related fields. 
I am very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Zhang Wei](http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/027886/zh_CN/index.htm) from the [Digital Signal Processing & RF Analog Integrated Circuit Design Laboratory](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qa6vTqODYB9mmEGBRZ5cPQ) of [Tianjin University's School of Microelectronics](http://sme.tju.edu.cn/).
